1471233729418960897 2021-12-16 05:40:29 +0800 <timnusser> @WernerHellwich @NicoVRNY @demoscopy10 @MarcoBuschmann @bmj_bund Nein, das Risiko eines *tödlichen* Verlaufs in der Zielgruppe ist sehr niedrig (aber auch nicht null). Nur: die meisten schweren Nebenwirkungen, die hier moniert werden, treten bei einer tatsächlichen Infektion mit COVID mit weitaus höherer Quote auf (z.B. Myokarditis). 
1471114195793973249 2021-12-15 21:45:30 +0800 <dwallbank> "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken scrapped the rest of his tour of Southeast Asia and will return to Washington after a member of the press traveling with him tested positive for Covid-19" 
1467887538727624710 2021-12-07 00:03:55 +0800 <dwallbank> Singapore's Ministry of Health, which has put out some of the more thorough country data on Covid anywhere, says it "will stop issuing daily press releases on infection statistics" as of Dec. 7 (tho data will still be tracked).  The delta wave here is subsiding. 
1467863087604658176 2021-12-06 22:26:46 +0800 <dwallbank> EU health ministers will consider adjusting the travel curbs currently imposed on southern Africa in response to the omicron variant  https://t.co/6UDjAhijtx via @bpolitics 
1467857340263124998 2021-12-06 22:03:56 +0800 <dwallbank> @moghilemear13 Incorrect. Literally the opposite of that. A lot of people lost their incomes from Covid, and many lost lives. That's nothing to celebrate. 
1466366381650157570 2021-12-02 19:19:23 +0800 <TanSiHuiCNA> JUST IN: Two imported COVID-19 cases test positive for Omicron. They arrived in Sg on 1 Dec and isolated upon arrival. MOH says they’ve not interacted in the community, with no evidence of transmission.

1465329074750980103 2021-11-29 22:37:30 +0800 <dwallbank> Serious Q: What percentage of people in the US do you think are currently worried about their own family's safety over the omicron variant (not just Covid generally), to the point they would change current actions or future plans? 
1465318746692603905 2021-11-29 21:56:28 +0800 <dwallbank> Coverage of supposed travel hesitancy in the United States should note that travel on the Sunday after Thanksgiving set a pandemic-era record.  Which is to say: If there is any actual omicron hesitancy in the US, we aren't seeing it in public aggregate data. 
1464963385347346433 2021-11-28 22:24:23 +0800 <dwallbank> I sincerely doubt that the US public rates omicron anywhere near as much of a threat as markets &amp; governments do.
