1494009551288369153 2022-02-17 02:03:29 +0800 <TideraceJenkins> I'll plug another statistic here: 2020 (latest available stat) saw 452 suicides locally, a 26% increase from 2019. Samaritans of Singapore chief exec seemingly attributes this to COVID. 
1494009549744848897 2022-02-17 02:03:28 +0800 <TideraceJenkins> Keep in mind that people who die WITH COVID is inevitable as the virus makes its way around. Comorbidities is another factor. At this point, there's much to be said about the impact of COVID on both physical and mental health, and how it's more damaging than COVID itself. 
1494009548226830336 2022-02-17 02:03:28 +0800 <TideraceJenkins> medical conditions. In fact, a closer look at the mortality numbers here shows that the Republic's death rate in 2021 is lower than the rates in 2016, 2017 and 2018 - before the Covid-19 pandemic began - and is only slightly higher than 2019 and 2020." 
1494009546670370816 2022-02-17 02:03:27 +0800 <TideraceJenkins> Straits Times, Nov 6 2021, [Singapore's overall death rate did not increase despite Covid-19]: "Singapore's overall death rate has not increased despite more deaths from Covid-19, ... because those who died from the virus would likely have otherwise perished from other 
1494009543507910659 2022-02-17 02:03:27 +0800 <TideraceJenkins> Next thing brought up was death count. Yes, we're seeing a rise in death count statistics locally. How significant is this? 7 people died on the 15th. What we're not told if they died WITH COVID, or OF COVID. Very different. 
1494009541909880835 2022-02-17 02:03:26 +0800 <TideraceJenkins> Singapore's issue is our people are stuck with the notion of our own flavor of "zero-COVID". Our measures at the start were so stringent that cases were kept so low, and people expect it to continue to be low despite virus mutations and global shifts. We know more now than then. 
1494009540324388869 2022-02-17 02:03:26 +0800 <TideraceJenkins> The fastest way to reduce the load A&amp;E and healthcare is facing is to treat COVID like a flu. We know 99.7% have no or mild symptoms (MOH statistic). The extra precautions are creating extreme stress on the system. 
1494009532380422148 2022-02-17 02:03:24 +0800 <TideraceJenkins> There were some differing opinions on a group chat about Singapore's reopening (or lack thereof) with regards to COVID-19.

1493611459313643521 2022-02-15 23:41:36 +0800 <LT3000Lyall> @PenttiJokinen I think this is already regulatory overreach and - along with other covid measures - and encroachment on people's civil liberties they have a right to protest. However, designating such protests terrorist activity and cutting off people's bank accounts are very extreme actions. 
1493611157999042563 2022-02-15 23:40:24 +0800 <LT3000Lyall> @PenttiJokinen You are right to some degree. Whatever one's view on vaccines from a personal protection standpoint, I don't think there is any legitimate basis to mandate people take them (particularly given the strong evidence we now have that they do not prevent the spread of covid).

1493518937761677312 2022-02-15 17:33:57 +0800 <seanongwx> 3/ All 5 Omicron patients had detectable #SARSCoV2 by PCR in respiratory aerosols, despite being fully-vaccinated (5/5) and asymptomatic (4/5). One subject also had a booster vaccine dose. In contrast, 2 of 4 Delta patients had detectable PCR in aerosol. SARSCoV2
1493518935693860866 2022-02-15 17:33:57 +0800 <seanongwx> 2/ Using the G-II bioaerosol sampler and similar methodology from our previous study ( https://t.co/e38KywjbpP), we collected aerosol samples from 4 Delta and 5 Omicron patients while singing, breathing, talking (w/ and w/o surgical mask), and sent these for PCR and viral culture.

It’s not like there is one type of vaccine? There are many different types, choose the one that is best for your body ffs. It’s not like you only have one type of choice 😭

Is it a pride thing at this point? I have no symptoms right now despite having covid and I strongly believe it’s because of my 3 jabs. If I wasn’t I believe I would be struggling a lot rn
