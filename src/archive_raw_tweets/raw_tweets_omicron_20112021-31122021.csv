Today is called t = 0 where t is defined as number of days since today  Y= 2^(1/2 X t) x 4  So in 1 month time. t=30 Y= 2^ (30) X 4   It's super huge number.

1467887538727624710 2021-12-07 00:03:55 +0800 <dwallbank> Singapore's Ministry of Health, which has put out some of the more thorough country data on Covid anywhere, says it "will stop issuing daily press releases on infection statistics" as of Dec. 7 (tho data will still be tracked).  The delta wave here is subsiding.

1467661914167656456 2021-12-06 09:07:22 +0800 <temptempholder> I believe I read that the govt expect the Omicron to be in community sooner or later.   So it's going to be more rules down the road for different categories like noninfected, infected but not officially known by govt, infected with delta, infected with Omicron, infected w both

1467188495789686786 2021-12-05 01:46:11 +0800 <plso1870> 85 percent of my brain in the past year has been occupied by Covid—keeping track of all CONSTANT regulation changes, making contingent plans for work, worrying about friends/family, getting angry at people who don't do the minimum. I don't remember what my brain was like before.

1466984258300354561 2021-12-04 12:14:37 +0800 <ervinl> Option 3: another reason mil heading back is to get more medicine for herself. Well with the extra she spending on hotel I think we can get medicine cheaper in sg. So ask her to stay put.  This covid and HK govt really unforgiving for the one who plans ahead 😅🤷🏾‍♂️🙄

1466964964959162369 2021-12-04 10:57:57 +0800 <temptempholder> Can we temporarily throw in 9 unelected PAP MP to serve Aljunied GRC and Sengkang GRC in name   Because our PAP is really really tired to do so many things in Omicron era and still have to do all tedious fact finding on Pritam lies and deal with supporters current wave of lies!
