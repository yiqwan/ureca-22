1471114195793973249 2021-12-15 21:45:30 +0800 <dwallbank> "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken scrapped the rest of his tour of Southeast Asia and will return to Washington after a member of the press traveling with him tested positive for Covid-19" 
1467887538727624710 2021-12-07 00:03:55 +0800 <dwallbank> Singapore's Ministry of Health, which has put out some of the more thorough country data on Covid anywhere, says it "will stop issuing daily press releases on infection statistics" as of Dec. 7 (tho data will still be tracked).  The delta wave here is subsiding. 
1467857340263124998 2021-12-06 22:03:56 +0800 <dwallbank> @moghilemear13 Incorrect. Literally the opposite of that. A lot of people lost their incomes from Covid, and many lost lives. That's nothing to celebrate. 
1466366381650157570 2021-12-02 19:19:23 +0800 <TanSiHuiCNA> JUST IN: Two imported COVID-19 cases test positive for Omicron. They arrived in Sg on 1 Dec and isolated upon arrival. MOH says they’ve not interacted in the community, with no evidence of transmission. 
1465329074750980103 2021-11-29 22:37:30 +0800 <dwallbank> Serious Q: What percentage of people in the US do you think are currently worried about their own family's safety over the omicron variant (not just Covid generally), to the point they would change current actions or future plans? 
1464378099500417026 2021-11-27 07:38:40 +0800 <eugenechoi> With this new “Omicron” variant, car manufacturers should be getting concerned that covid variants are going to potentially take all the good names for new car models

1462350778362843142 2021-11-21 17:22:49 +0800 <ainunnajib> Penting banget ini survei seroprevalensi.  Seberapa banyak % penduduk Indonesia yang sudah pernah terinfeksi COVID-19 
1461750042725785604 2021-11-20 01:35:42 +0800 <SherlynSeahCNA> Spoke to KKH for this:  Trial is key in getting young kids protected, as they’re “one of the most vulnerable” now - at high risk of getting inflammatory response from COVID-19.  Vaccination could let kids resume more activities too - be it social interactions, school programmes. 
1459317721397559303 2021-11-13 08:30:32 +0800 <dwallbank> Singapore Covid ratio now above 1 (above the level needed for more easing). Reasons why stated in thread below.  https://t.co/1aDvLvTXmj 
1458460912302444546 2021-11-10 23:45:53 +0800 <dwallbank> Covid community cases in Singapore are EXACTLY where they were a week ago.   But week/week is rising. Why? Because an outlier spike that was part of last week's count is now aged out of the count.

1444686687859208202 2021-10-03 23:32:02 +0800 <dwallbank> Singapore Covid cases decline for a second day in a row, but I want to see Monday's report before I start coming to conclusions here

1493595370005401603 2022-02-15 22:37:40 +0800 <Tushar307> 11/ Getting PMF for both the actual product &amp; token simultaneously is hard AF - it is also the sweetest feeling :)  As for $XPRT, it remains at the absolute CORE &amp; derives value from ALL financial activity taking place in Persistence ecosystem    Details:  https://t.co/ktB6izlGiM 
1493595366268280836 2022-02-15 22:37:39 +0800 <Tushar307> 10/ I have already talked about some of the other key metrics that we’ll be tracking this year in a previous thread which will also be fundamental to driving $XPRT’s growth   https://t.co/vekUsz1mha 
1493595363294560264 2022-02-15 22:37:38 +0800 <Tushar307> 9/ Economic activity leads to value accrual in a few ways:  🟢 Txn fees from the various dApps  🟢 Hub routing (Persistence as a tried and tested chain to run IBC tons through as the no. of chains increase)  🟢 IBC txns 
1493595359871913992 2022-02-15 22:37:38 +0800 <Tushar307> 8/ Medium-term value accrual to $XPRT will be driven by use-cases of stkASSETs (borrowing/lending etc)  The uses-cases will be driven through a 3 pronged approach:  🟢 Modular  🟢 Smart-contract  🟢 App-chain (driven by independent teams)  https://t.co/2xy4GOGRCO 
1493595350078308367 2022-02-15 22:37:35 +0800 <Tushar307> 7/ In the short term, a big part of value accrual to $XPRT is going to be driven from the stkASSET issuance (stkATOM, stkXPRT) from @pStakeFinance dApp on Persistence Core-1 chain  Details in the blog published earlier on our goals for 2022:  https://t.co/njJgLwGarF 
1493595347259740169 2022-02-15 22:37:35 +0800 <Tushar307> 6/ While the foundations of the project have strengthened on the inside, some of the key aspects on the external token side have suffered   Along with the team and some key community members, I’ll be attempting to fix this 
1493595344168435719 2022-02-15 22:37:34 +0800 <Tushar307> 5/ As for my experience  After a huge push on the ‘external’ aspects of building a crypto project for the first 2 quarters of $XPRT 's existence (Apr-Sep '21)  Over the past 1.5 quarters, I have been spending more time on the ‘internal’ aspects (processes, culture, key hires etc) 
1493595341316313104 2022-02-15 22:37:33 +0800 <Tushar307> ...  BD (w/ validators, exchanges, developers, investors, liquidity providers, other projects, wallet &amp; explorer providers, custodians etc)   Just as a starting point….and then you MAYYY have a shot at some success 
1493595338481053702 2022-02-15 22:37:33 +0800 <Tushar307> 4/ As a crypto founder, you have to get the following things right (to name a few):  - Research - Hiring - (Actual) product development - Design UI/UX - Documentation - Tokenomics design - Marketing... 
1493595335507197957 2022-02-15 22:37:32 +0800 <Tushar307> 3/ However, one has to get BOTH products (actual product AND token) right at the same time  Adoption for the actual product doesn’t necessarily translate into value accrual for the token. And vice versa.    BOTH products require constant ‘Product Management’! 
1493595332495687686 2022-02-15 22:37:31 +0800 <Tushar307> 2/ Despite the numerous challenges, a token creates unique opportunities for any founder   It is ammo for hiring, marketing, brand building, community building, BD, customer acquisition/retention 
1493595329282912256 2022-02-15 22:37:30 +0800 <Tushar307> 1/ As a founder in crypto, you are building an early stage tech company VERY publicly    You are required to:  Manage your actual product Manage the token as a product   A thread on the latter from my experience of managing $XPRT! 
1493594956442836996 2022-02-15 22:36:01 +0800 <ASvanevik> If you don’t like LooksRare, here’s an idea:  Build your own NFT marketplace and design the tokenomics the way you want.

1493434793820057600 2022-02-15 11:59:36 +0800 <kixes> 13/ And this is pain that doesn't end once the death sentence is carried out—it is trauma that they will have to carry with them for the rest of their lives. 
1493434792222007296 2022-02-15 11:59:35 +0800 <kixes> 12/ It's deeply traumatic to receive execution notices just 1 week before, and be expected to juggle prison visits, breaking the news to other family members, coordinating arrangements (travel or funeral arrangements, often both), on top of personal mental and emotional anguish. 
1493434790745612291 2022-02-15 11:59:35 +0800 <kixes> 11/ It is horrifying for families to have the spectre of death—which, unlike any other circumstance, can be scheduled down to the minute—hanging over their heads, often for years. 
1493434789113724928 2022-02-15 11:59:35 +0800 <kixes> 10/ What I've learnt from the families I've worked with is that every person is more than the mistakes they've made. The death penalty regime doesn't recognise that, and it doesn't just punish the individual who was convicted of the offence. It punishes the entire family. 
1493434787079798784 2022-02-15 11:59:34 +0800 <kixes> 9/ This is a soothing message for ourselves because then we don't have to think about it any further. But from what I've witnessed over the years, over multiple death row cases, is that there are so many factors that affect the choices that people make. 
1493434785439821824 2022-02-15 11:59:34 +0800 <kixes> 8/ Many of us find it easier to just brand everyone in prison, and especially on death row, as "criminals" and forget about them. We tell ourselves "if they didn't want to face the consequences then, they shouldn't have done the crime". 
1493434783644647425 2022-02-15 11:59:33 +0800 <kixes> 7/ Ethnic minorities are also disproportionately represented on death row. When we find that a system is repeatedly and disproportionately affecting marginalised communities and vulnerable people, we should really be asking if such a system can really be described as "justice". 
1493434782210228226 2022-02-15 11:59:33 +0800 <kixes> 6/ In my years working on this issue, I have come across cases of people on death row who were struggling with poverty, histories of suffering from abuse, drug dependency or addiction, mental health conditions or psychosocial disabilities. 
1493434780415053826 2022-02-15 11:59:32 +0800 <kixes> 5/ We buy into this narrative so much that it's almost as if it doesn't matter to people that this is not actually supported by evidence. 
1493434778703785984 2022-02-15 11:59:32 +0800 <kixes> 4/ We take pride in how relentless and merciless we can be, telling ourselves that we're just being pragmatic and tough and that's why Singapore's streets are cleaner and safer and we are doing better than others. 
1493434776916983809 2022-02-15 11:59:32 +0800 <kixes> 3/ Singapore operates on very punitive logic—we think that if we police more, if we bring in harsh penalties and tell everyone about how "zero tolerance" we are, then we are solving problems. 
1493434775193157633 2022-02-15 11:59:31 +0800 <kixes> 2/ There’s no clear evidence the death penalty is more effective than any other punishment in deterring drug offences. The issues of drug use, drug dependency and the drug trade are complex and can’t be eliminated/"solved" by harsh penalties and sending people to their deaths. 
1493434773502820353 2022-02-15 11:59:31 +0800 <kixes> 1/ Sharing more of the comments I sent @VICEWorldNews:  It's very disappointing that the Singapore government is so determined to continue executions, after zero executions in both 2020 and 2021.

1493288284524535811 2022-02-15 02:17:25 +0800 <AssaadRazzouk> Direct climate action by citizens can and should take many forms ranging from peaceful protests to leveraging the power of the blockchain - as I described in a recent podcast  10/   https://t.co/vDSKJZv4Nh 
1493287883796537347 2022-02-15 02:15:50 +0800 <AssaadRazzouk> Conclusion: There is no substitute for direct climate action  “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has”  – Margaret Mead  9/ 
1493287639604150276 2022-02-15 02:14:51 +0800 <AssaadRazzouk> Loved this factoid too: Banks say they want to help clients transition, but almost none are asking that their oil &amp; gas clients publish transition plans by a specific date, let alone clarifying what these plans should entail  8/ 
1493287523799420931 2022-02-15 02:14:24 +0800 <AssaadRazzouk> Banks are nowhere to be found in terms of restricting financing to oil &amp; gas projects: La Banque Postale is the only one announcing it would exit the oil &amp; gas sector by 2030 and will no longer finance oil &amp; gas companies unless they commit to phase-out oil &amp; gas activities  7/  https://t.co/2COV4WzVJd 
1493287360888549382 2022-02-15 02:13:45 +0800 <AssaadRazzouk> Loved this factoid: On 11 Nov 2021, as #COP26 was unfolding, a syndicate of banks including BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, BPCE, Soc Gen and UniCredit provided US$6bn to Vår Energi, one of the largest upstream oil &amp; gas destroyers of the Arctic region   6/ COP26
1493287197981687811 2022-02-15 02:13:06 +0800 <AssaadRazzouk> Net-zero commitments are evidently a joke: “Net-Zero Banking Alliance” provided US$38bn in financing to oil &amp; gas expansion since the launch of the alliance in 2021  5/ 
1493287025553903616 2022-02-15 02:12:25 +0800 <AssaadRazzouk> But #ClimateCrisis be damned: Banks are increasing financing to oil &amp; gas expansion in 2021 v. 2016-2019 average:  -&gt;BNP Paribas +16% -&gt;BPCE + 49% -&gt;Deutsche +44% -&gt;NatWest +63% -&gt;Nordea +18% -&gt;Standard Chartered +24% -&gt;HSBC +7%  4/ ClimateCrisis
1493286855726534658 2022-02-15 02:11:44 +0800 <AssaadRazzouk> Yet, [even] the IEA has closed the door to new oil &amp; gas fields: There is no room for new oil &amp; gas fields in its Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 pathway, now a central scenario of the World Energy Outlook  3/ 
1493286745881944069 2022-02-15 02:11:18 +0800 <AssaadRazzouk> And that’s just the European banks, the most allegedly "progressive" of the lot!   2/ 
1493286570811666441 2022-02-15 02:10:37 +0800 <AssaadRazzouk> There is no substitute for citizens taking direct climate action: We're in a #ClimateCrisis yet our institutions are acting recklessly. @ShareAction report shows that European banks in UN-led Net Zero Banking Alliance funded US$400bn in new oil &amp; gas since 2016  THREAD #climate  https://t.co/15UXiu9dOg ClimateCrisis,climate

1465318746692603905 2021-11-29 21:56:28 +0800 <dwallbank> Coverage of supposed travel hesitancy in the United States should note that travel on the Sunday after Thanksgiving set a pandemic-era record.
